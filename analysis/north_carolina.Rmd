## Discussion: 
Looking at the graph, it is clear that the Supreme Court is far older than the Court of Appeals. At first I wondered if the lack of cases for the court of appeals was because of lack of records or an error in the database. However, after googling I discovered the the court of appeals was actually made to take some stress off the supreme court. This is interesting because there doesn't seem to be a steady increase in the number of cases that the supreme court handled leading up to the formation of the court of appeals in the 1960s. However, once the court of appeasl was formed, you can see a sharp dip in the number of cases that the supreme court took on. The court of appeal's formation, there appears to have been increases in the number of cases in the supreme court while the cases in the court of appeals have remained steady until the 2000s where there has been sharp fluctuations in the caseload for both courts.
