# Eventually I will page through a ton of bbc news article pages and join them
# page by page into a giant tibble. Then I will clean it. Currently, I am just
# using one page to clean. First I read in the first page csv into bbc and then
# used clean names. Then using select, I selected the title, description,
# published at and content columns.
